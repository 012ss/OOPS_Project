**Smart Parking Spot Management System**  

Urban areas face increasing challenges with efficient parking management. Traditional parking systems often suffer from inefficiencies such as:  
- Random spot allocation.
- Lack of reservations and guarantees for frequent users.
- No dynamic pricing based on demand or convenience.
- Poor user experience due to lack of real-time visibility.

The goal is to build a Parking Spot Management System using Ruby (OOP + CLI) that:
- Assigns and releases parking spots dynamically.
- Supports time-based releases and reservations.
- Implements dynamic pricing based on:
    - Occupancy rate.
    - Proximity to exit.
- User membership type.
- Supports memberships for daily or VIP customers.
- Provides real-time visualization of parking lot status on the CLI.
